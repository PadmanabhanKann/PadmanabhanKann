# Hi there! I'm Padmanabhan Kannan üëã

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Fourth year Int-MS student from **IISER Thiruvananthapuram**, 
majoring in **Biology** with a minor in **Physics**. My primary interest lies in addressing complex biological questions through computational approaches.
My current focus is on exploring the **evolutionary relationships through genomic analysis**.
